The Physics Club aims to foster an interest in physics while providing a welcoming community with various resources for those already involved in the subject. We have presentations on a variety of topics in the physics world, conduct demonstrations that highlight concepts not covered in a traditional physics class, host review sessions for unit tests and AP exams, and host competitions including training sessions.

## Handouts

Physics Club produced the following handouts for physics courses offered at school. See the [info](./handouts/info.pdf) document for details.
